# Process Simulation

Some mini projects exploring simulation of processes relating to different systems - science, engineering, operations etc.

- Queueing: using queueing theory (M/M/c/N queues) and discrete event simulation to investigate how maximum queue length affects total customers served.
- Control System: using a PID controller and Kalman filter to make a car follow a set point speed.
- Chemical Mixing Plant: simulating the dynamics of a stirred tank reactor (CSTR) as inlet concentrations vary.
- Heat transfer pipe: calculating the heat transfer and wall temperatures of a steam heater pipe.
